# toolchains/ios.cmake
# Minimal iOS toolchain for building static libraries with CMake + Xcode.
# Usage (examples):
#   cmake -S . -B build/ios-device-rel \
#     -G Xcode \
#     -D CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=toolchains/ios.cmake \
#     -D CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT=iphoneos \
#     -D CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=arm64 \
#     -D CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=13.0 \
#     -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
#
#   cmake -S . -B build/ios-sim-rel \
#     -G Xcode \
#     -D CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=toolchains/ios.cmake \
#     -D CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT=iphonesimulator \
#     -D CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=arm64 \
#     -D CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=13.0 \
#     -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
